CZOWOFWaterML1
==============

Everything about the CZO use of CUAHSI HIS WaterOneFlow and WaterML 1.x

This repository will cover anything involving the configuration and use of these services by the CZO community, from [the centralized services at CZO Central](http://central.criticalzone.org/pub_services.aspx) to more custom deployments by individual CZO's, such as the [Christina River CZO system](http://swrcsensors.dreamhosters.com/). That scope may include assessing and documenting how the [CZO shared vocabularies](http://sv.criticalzone.org/) are being used in these WOF services.
